## lile: Linux Interactive Lxroot Environment
Lile is a shell script wrapper for https://github.com/parke/lxroot to create environments (such as debian, ubuntu, etc. with native performance).
#### How does it work?
Rootfs (obvious), fakeroot (mount /dev, /proc, and /sys), and lxroot (also obvious) are three things  needed
#### Features (that I will work on)
* Native performance - In lxroot
* Lile windows in the host (and DEs?) - Know how to do, working on
* Easy-to-use interactive shell script wrapper for lile - Working on
* Other distros (right now lxroot only supports Debian/Ubuntu) - Working on
